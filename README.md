Hello, I'm Joseph Saadaâ€”a passionate Software Engineer who earned my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from UC Irvine in just three years. Drawing upon a robust technical skill set in Python, JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like React and AWS, I've effectively contributed to innovative projects and transformative solutions throughout my career.

At Walmart Global Tech, I played a key role in building a site from the ground up using React (TypeScript) and Java Spring Boot, significantly improving internal microsite management and saving developers valuable time. I departed from that role as part of a company restructuring, which has opened the door for me to explore new and exciting opportunities. I am now actively seeking my next challenge where I can further leverage my skills, creativity, and passion for technology to make a significant impact.

Thank you!
